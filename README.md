final CPA submission

Name: Fantasy Football Trader

Elevator Pitch: Many people play Fantasy Football, where people manage imaginary teams based on real-world stats. This app allows users to evaluate potential trades, keep track of their players and league settings, and see lists of player stat projections. When developed further, with proper access to player projections, this app has the potential to analyze more complex trades and highlight team weaknesses.

Developer notes: This app uses flatlists and SafeAreaView to display player projections. It uses buttons to switch between screens. It uses StyleSheet, View, and Text for obvious reasons. It uses TextInput and useState to store player names. It uses useState to store other values. It uses useEffect and async storage to store numbers of players in a lineup. It uses NavigationContainer and createNativeStackNavigator to navigate through different screens. Finally, though currently unnecessary, it uses Context to store a number.
